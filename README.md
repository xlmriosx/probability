# probability

Probability is a belief that we have about the occurrence of elementary events.

In what cases do we use probability?

Intuitively, we make estimates of the probability that something happens or not, due to ignorance
that we have about the relevant information of an event we call it uncertainty.

Chance in these terms does not exist, it represents the absence of knowledge of all
the variables that make up a system.

In other words, probability is a language that allows us to quantify uncertainty

AXIOMS:
It is a set of sentences that cannot be derived from something more fundamental. We take them for the truth
and not demonstration.

"Sometimes axioms are compared to seeds, because the whole theory arises from them"
Axioms
PROBABILITY AXIOMS:

The probability is given by the number of successful cases over the total (theoretical) number of cases.

P = # -Successful cases / # Total-cases.

Elemental event: It is a single occurrence, "You only have one side of the coin as a result."

Events: These are the possibilities we have in the system. It is composed of elementary events,
for example, "The result of rolling a die is even", there are three events (2,4,6) that make up this statement.

Two schools of thought diverge from the interpretation of the previous axiom. Frequentist and Bayesian

Example: “I only have two possible outcomes when tossing a coin, 50% probability for each head
, (1/2 and 1/2), if I flip the coin n times, the coin doesn't land half the time on one head, and then the other "

This equiprobability of occurrence in a sample space occurs under the assumption that
the success / total ratio tends to a p-value. In other words, just flipping the coin
infinitely many times we can see that the probability value is close to (1/2 or 50%).
Frequentist school

"Every random variable is described by the sample space that contains all possible events
of that random problem ”.

The probability that is assigned as a value to each possible event has several properties to be fulfilled

AXIOMS PROPERTIES:

0 <= P <= 1
Certainty: P = 1
Impossibility P = 0
Disjunction P (AuB) = P (A) + P (B)
